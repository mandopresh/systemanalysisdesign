System Analysis and Design

In this course I was involved in creating requirements and designing different types of uml diagrams for DriverPass. The DriverPass project was designed for students who would like to work on getting their drivers license through an online program. The client wanted the system to be built for student drivers to register for driving courses online. The type of system that was asked to be designed was one where accounts can be created and, once in, the student can select the packages they would like to enroll in. The user will be able to get online, take training and then complete tests. They are able to monitor their progress. The client would like to be able to have access to all the accounts that are created to be monitored. 

Personally, I think I got better at creating the diagrams and the use of Lucidchart. By the end of the course I felt really decent at using the different shapes and organizing the information better than I was when I first began.

I would probably choose to revise the security aspect. I did not incorporate security as much as I would have wanted to in my diagrams because I was focusing on every other thing that was being asked. Going back, I would make sure to include more two-step authentication steps, ways to help users feel more secure when it comes to using the program.

The way I interpreted the users needs was by breaking down all the requirements that were being asked during the conversation. I tried to make sure that I included everything to the best of my ability. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing the system because without the user the system will not be picked up or used. 

When designing software in the future, I would start by gathering the system requirements. The system requirements are really important because without them the system will not be what is expected by the client. I would accept feedback and from there make sure that we are incorporating the feedback to get the system to where it's supposed to be.
